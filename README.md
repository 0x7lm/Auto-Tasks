# AutomatedTasksWithSubscription Service

AutomatedTasksWithSubscription is a decentralized service that allows developers to easily schedule and execute automated tasks on the blockchain. With subscription management integrated, users can seamlessly manage their subscriptions and automate tasks based on their requirements.

## Features

- **Subscription Management**: Users can subscribe to the service and extend their subscriptions to access automated task scheduling functionality.
- **Flexible Task Scheduling**: Developers can schedule automated tasks by specifying the time interval, target contract address, and encoded function call data.
- **Efficient Upkeep Mechanism**: The service efficiently checks for and performs upkeep on scheduled tasks, ensuring timely execution.
- **Decentralized and Secure**: Built on blockchain technology, the service is decentralized and secure, providing trustless automation capabilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AutomatedTasksWithSubscription service, follow these steps:

1. **Subscription**: Subscribe to the service by calling the `subscribe` function and sending the required payment.
2. **Task Scheduling**: Schedule automated tasks by calling the `scheduleTask` function and specifying the task parameters.
3. **Upkeep**: Use the `checkUpkeep` and `performUpkeep` functions to check for and perform upkeep on scheduled tasks.
4. **Subscription Management**: Extend your subscription using the `extendSubscription` function to continue accessing the service.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the AutomatedTasksWithSubscription service:

```solidity
// Solidity example
contract MyContract {
    IAutomatedTasksWithSubscription public service;

    constructor(address _serviceAddress) {
        service = IAutomatedTasksWithSubscription(_serviceAddress);
    }

    function subscribeToService() external payable {
        service.subscribe{value: msg.value}();
    }

    // Schedule a task to call a function on another contract every 24 hours
    function scheduleTask(address _target, bytes calldata _data) external {
        uint256 interval = 24 hours;
        service.scheduleTask(interval, _target, _data);
    }
}
```

## Requirements

- **Ethereum Wallet**: You'll need an Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the service.
- **Etherscan**: You can use Etherscan to explore the contract and view transaction details.
- **Ether (ETH)**: Subscription payments and gas fees are required for interacting with the service.
